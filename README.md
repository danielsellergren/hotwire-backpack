# Hotwire Backback Items Tutorial

This is a simple Rails 7 project that allows the user to add and remove `Items` from a `Backpack`. It uses Hotwire and specifically Turbo Frames to do this without page reloads, demonstrating an easy way to build a dynamic web application with zero explicit JavaScript.

This project accompanies [the tutorial](https://danielsellergren.com/blog/building-a-live-updating-list-of-items-in-rails-7-with-hotwire) at [DanielSellergren.com](https://danielsellergren.com) so check that out to follow along with each commit along with explanations.
